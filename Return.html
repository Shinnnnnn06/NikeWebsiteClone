<h2> WHAT IS NIKE’S RETURN POLICY?</h2>

<p> All purchases made on Nike.com, in any of the Nike apps, or at a Nike store have a 60-day return period. Go ahead and test out your Nike or Converse purchase to make sure it works for you. </p>
<p> You can return items (some exceptions apply) for any reason within those 60 days. That includes custom Nike By You sneakers. Even after 60 days, you can still return items if they’re unworn and unwashed. And remember, returns are always free for Nike Members.</p>
