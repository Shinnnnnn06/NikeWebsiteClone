            <h2> DO NIKE SHOES HAVE A WARRANTY? </h2>

        <p> We stand behind all of our shoes and gear. If your Nike shoes or apparel develop a material or workmanship flaw within two years of the manufacture date, we want to get you back in the game.</p>

            <p>   If you believe your item is flawed, and it’s within 60 days of your purchase, you can simply return it to us for a full refund. For Nike.com and Nike App purchases, please see our return instructions (and if you want to try to exchange the item, </p>
                <p>   you’ll need to give us a call). For Nike store purchases, you’ll want to take your item back to a Nike store.</p>
            
                    <p>  If it’s been longer than 60 days, and less than two years since the manufacture date (located on the item’s tag), and the item has developed a flaw, here's what you need to do:</p>


            <ul>
                        <li> Nike.com and Nike App Orders: Please contact us to return the item. (This includes digital Nike.com orders placed at a Nike Store.)</li> <br> 
                        <li> Nike Store Purchases: Even after 60 days, you'll still need to return the item to a Nike store. If you cannot visit in person, contact the store to discuss your options. </li> <br> 
                        <li> Nike Authorized Store Purchases: Please return your shoes to the original place of purchase. We work with authorized retailers to accept returns for products with a material or workmanship flaw. If you cannot return to the original place of purchase, or if the retailer has referred you back to Nike, you can file a claim.</li> <br>   




            </ul>
