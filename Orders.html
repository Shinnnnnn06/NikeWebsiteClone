    <h2> WHERE IS MY NIKE ORDER? </h2>

    <p> The most accurate and current information for your Nike order is always available at nike.com/orders. Nike Members can also sign in to access their order information.</p>
    <p> After your order ships, you can track your shipment(s) and see which carrier is delivering your package(s) anytime at nike.com/orders. And please note, if you order multiple items, you may get multiple deliveries. For each shipment, we’ll send you a shipping confirmation email with the carrier tracking number and a link to track the shipment. </p> 
    <br>
    <p> Nike Members can also check their order status anytime in the Nike App. Simply tap the Profile tab, then "Orders." Tap on the specific order to check the status. And if your order has shipped, you can tap "Track Shipment" to track your package(s).</p>


    <h2> FAQs </h2>
    
    <h3> Who should I contact about order tracking and delivery?</h3>
    <p> After your order leaves our facility, we won’t have any additional information beyond what you see when you track your package(s). If you have delivery-related questions during shipment or want more specific tracking information, please contact the carrier directly:</p>
    <u>
        <li> FedEx</li>
        <li> UPS</li>
        <li> LaserShip</li>
        <li> OnTrac </li>
        <li> LSO <l/i>
    </u>

    <h3> Where do I find my estimated delivery date? </h3>

    <p> You’ll see an estimated order delivery date during checkout, on your order status page, and when you track your order. Because this date is an estimate, your order could be delivered shortly before or shortly after this date.</p>


    <h3> Can I change the delivery address on my order? </h3>
    
    <p> No, our team moves quickly to process and ship your order—we cannot change your order or your delivery address. However, after your order ships, you can contact the carrier directly to see if they can update the address or redirect the package to a pickup facility. </p>

    <h3> Where do I find my tracking number? </h3>

    <p> When your order ships, we’ll send you an email with the carrier tracking number (note: this is a separate email from your original order confirmation email). You can also access your tracking number at nike.com/orders. From there, click or tap "View or Manage," then "Track Shipment." </p>
